# Email
A simple email server I made as I wasnt able to find any email servers with my use case of being able to send an email from any username on a domain with out doing any config.
## Should you use this
**No** probably not. This is not optimized at all and one wrong json file will cause the whole thing to panic and stop. 
## Setup
go to branch love.
